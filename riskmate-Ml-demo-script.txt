We have taken a ML driven approach where the first step is to group the existing customers into different cohorts. This is a one time activity and has been done with unsupervised machine learning techniques in python using the sample historical data. Once we have the segments or cohorts created, we analyse and identify differentiating attributes for these cohorts.

The next step is to use this information to identify and assign attributes for any customer visitng the website. In the backround there is a machine learning model which is trained to classify the cohorts of any cutomer based on his/her attributes like demographics, benefit coverage, adverse disclosure etc. We have used Azure Machine Learning to run multiple classification models using Azure AutoML with a click of a few buttons and deployed the best model with highest accuracy and recall as a real time API end point.

We call the API with the information of any customer who visits the websites and the insights of respective cohorts is presented back to the customer on the website itself. This is dynamic and will change according to the customer attributes, so the customers really see a personalised data backed insights tailored to his/her needs.
